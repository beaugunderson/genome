My genetic data
===============

This repo exists to hold all of my genetic data and follows the example set by [msporny](https://github.com/msporny/dna).

It currently contains my data export from 23andMe and some other genetic test results I've had done (ApoE status, a BRCA2 mutation).

I am also enrolled in the [Personal Genome Project](https://my.personalgenomes.org/profile/huF06AD0).
